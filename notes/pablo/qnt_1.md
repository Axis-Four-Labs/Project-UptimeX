## Chapter 2 (Continued)

A highly recommended resource for understanding **complex vector spaces** in quantum computing is this MIT OpenCourseWare lecture:  
**[5. Linear Algebra: Vector Spaces and Operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZzBK3oy-08)**.

Much of Chapter 2 requires a solid grasp of linear algebra involving complex numbers, along with concepts from abstract algebra.

Additionally, this [UCL resource](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmto/0005_2021/Ch4.S14.html) provides a clear explanation of **Section 2.3: Basis and Dimension** in the context of linear maps. It supports a deeper understanding of the topic.
