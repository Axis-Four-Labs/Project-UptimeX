# Axis Four Labs

Axis Four Labs is a structured academic research site focused on advancing mastery in quantum computing, cryptography, cybersecurity, and systems engineering. The project outlines a progressive 5-level framework combining theoretical learning, simulation projects, and technical publication.

## Project Overview

This site hosts:

- A detailed roadmap divided into five levels of progression (Level 1-5)
- Individual corpus pages for each team member
- A simulation timeline with completion targets
- Core training content including tools, links, and project walkthroughs
- Styled modal components representing key domain areas: Math, Programming, Networking, Cybersecurity, Quantum, and Systems

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 / CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (modal/dialog system)
- Vanilla JavaScript (timeline scroll logic, animation controls)


Open `index.html` in any browser, or use the VS Code Live Server extension for development.

## Hosting

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages. DNS is managed through Squarespace and configured to point to GitHubâ€™s nameservers. The `CNAME` file in the root directory sets the custom domain (`axisfourlabs.com`).

## Formatting and Tools

Recommended extensions for VS Code:

- Prettier (automatic HTML/CSS/JS formatting)
- Live Server (development preview)
- Path Intellisense

Enable format-on-save via settings:

```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true
